COMMERCIAL LEASE 
(TRIPLE NET WITH LANDLORD SERVICES LEASE) 
(Form last revised 03/30/00) 
ARTICLE 1.00 BASIC LEASE TERMS 
1.01 Parties. This lease agreement (Lease) is entered into by and between the following Lessor and Lessee: 
ACLP BETHANY, L.P., a Texas limited partnership (Lessor), and XTERA COMMUNICATIONS, INC., a Delaware
corporation (Lessee).  1.02 Leased Premises. In consideration of the rents, terms, provisions and covenants of
this Lease, Lessor hereby leases, lets and demises to the Lessee the following described premises (Leased Premises): 
84.518 rentable square feet (Approximate sq. ft. in Leased Premises) 
84.518 rentable square feet (Approximate sq. ft. in Building) 
Allen Tech Center (Name of building or project) 
500 West Bethany Drive, Suite 100 (Street address/suite number) 
Allen, Texas 75013 (City, State, and Zip Code), located on the land shown on 
Exhibit A attached hereto and incorporated herein for all purposes. 
Together with all parking areas and driveways serving the Building (as shown on Exhibit B), Lessee shall occupy 50,000
rentable square feet (the Initial Leased Premises) of the Building, as depicted on Exhibit B attached hereto and made a part hereof for all purposes, upon Commencement Date of the Lease. The Initial Leased
Premises shall be increased by 34,518 rentable square feet (Must Take Space) within four (4) months from the Commencement Date and shall run concurrently with the Term of the Lease. At such time as the Must Take Space is
occupied, base rent shall be increased by $11.27 per square foot for the Must Take Space. See Section 6.01(d)  Lessee acknowledges that
the square footage of the Leased Premises is as set forth above. For purposes hereof, the Lessor and Lessee agree that while the Leased Premises includes the driveways and parking areas, the assumed square footage of such areas outside of the
Building shall be zero.  1.03 Term. Subject to and upon the conditions set forth herein, the term (the Term) of
this Lease commences one hundred twenty (120) days after execution of this Lease by Lessee and Lessor (the Commencement Date), and terminates eighty- eight (88) months thereafter (the Termination
Date). If Substantial Completion (as hereinafter defined) is delayed due to Lessor Delay (as hereinafter defined) or Force Majeure (as hereinafter defined), Lessor and Lessee agree that the Commencement Date will be delayed by the
difference between (i) number of days of Lessor Delay and Force Majeure, minus (ii) Lessee Delay (as hereinafter defined), in which event the Term shall be automatically extended for a like number of days. The Commencement




Date shall not be delayed due to Lessee Delay (hereinafter defined). If the Commencement Date is delayed, Lessor and Lessee shall, upon such delivery, execute an amendment to this Lease setting
forth the actual Commencement Date and Termination Date. Lessee shall be permitted full access to the Building to begin construction of Lessee Improvements upon full execution of this Lease by Lessee and Lessor; provided, however, that the terms of
indemnification and insurance under this Lease shall be applicable. Lessor shall provide all necessary building services during such construction phase and Lessee shall not be charged for such services during the constructions period, i.e. prior the
Commencement Date. If the Termination Date falls on a day other than the last day of a month, the parties agree that the Term is automatically extended by the number of days necessary to cause the Term to end on the last day of a month. 
1.04 Base Rent, Security Deposit. Base Rent is based on $11.27 per rentable square foot and payable as set forth below. The Security
Deposit is $79,376.49.

1.06 Permitted Use. General office, telecommunications switch center and research,
development and light manufacturing lab for development of telecommunications or other related products, and other related uses. Lessee may also operate an employee cafeteria. 
ARTICLE 2.00 RENT 
2.01 Base Rent. Lessee agrees to pay monthly as base rent during the term of this Lease without notice, demand, counter-claim, set-off
or abatement, except as otherwise set forth herein, the sum of money set forth in Section 1.04 of this Lease, which amount is payable to Lessor at the address shown above. One monthly installment of rent is due and payable on the date of
execution of this Lease by Lessee for the first months rent and a like monthly installment is due and payable on or before the first day of each calendar month succeeding the Commencement Date during the term of this Lease; provided, if the
Commencement Date should be a date other than the first day of a calendar month, the monthly rental set forth above will be prorated to the end of that calendar month and all succeeding installments of rent are payable on or before the first day of
each succeeding calendar month during the term of this Lease. Lessee shall pay, as additional rent, all other sums due under this Lease. 
2.02 Additional Rent. Lessee agrees to pay as additional rent, without deduction or set-off of any kind except as otherwise set forth
herein, Lessees pro rata share of all ad valorem taxes and installments of special assessments (including dues and assessments by means of deed restrictions and/or owners associations) lawfully levied or assessed against the Building (as
hereinafter defined) of which the Leased Premises are a part and any and all insurance required herein or which is standard for similar projects (specifically including fire and casualty, commercial general liability and rent loss insurance). Said
ad valorem taxes, assessments and insurance shall be prorated and paid on or before the first day of every month commencing on the Commencement Date, in advance, as additional rent. The pro ration shall be based upon Lessors estimate of ad
valorem taxes, assessments and insurance for the current calendar year, provided, that in the event Lessor is required under a mortgage, deed of trust, underlying lease or loan agreement covering the Building to escrow ad valorem taxes, assessments
or insurance, Lessor may but shall not be obligated, to use the amount required to be escrowed as a basis for its estimate. There will be an annual accounting as to actual ad valorem taxes, assessments and insurance and appropriate payment or
credits made. To the extent the Commencement Date or termination date of this Lease is not on the first day of the calendar year or last day of the calendar year respectively, Lessees liability for ad valorem taxes, assessments and insurance shall
be subject to a pro rata adjustment based on the number of days of any such year during which the Term is in effect. Lessee shall have the right at its expense to contest or appeal by appropriate proceedings any value assessment rendered by
applicable taxing authorities and Lessor shall cooperate to the extent reasonably necessary in such contest or appeal. To the extent the Leased Premises are part of a multi-occupancy building, Lessee shall pay a pro rata share of such ad valorem
taxes, assessments and insurance, such pro rata share to be equal to the product obtained by multiplying the total of such real property taxes assessments and insurance by a fraction, the

numerator of which shall be the number of square feet of floor area of the Leased Premises and the denominator of which shall be the number of square feet of floor area in the Building of which
the Leased Premises are a part.  2.03 Operating Expenses. Lessee agrees to pay, as additional rent, Lessees pro rata share
(as determined by the formula set forth in Section 2.02 above) of Lessors Operating Expenses (hereinafter defined) for the Building without deduction or set-off of any kind except as otherwise set forth herein. Lessor may invoice Lessee
monthly for Lessees pro rata share of the estimated Operating Expenses for each calendar year, which amount shall be adjusted from time-to-time based upon anticipated Operating Expenses. As of the date hereof, it is estimated that the
Operating Expenses for calendar year 2000 will be approximately $2.44 per rentable square foot. Lessor agrees that Lessees obligation to pay Controllable Operating Expenses (i.e., all Operating Expenses other than taxes, insurance and utility
costs) shall not be increased by more than five percent (5%) per annum on a cumulative per square foot basis. Within four months following the close of each calendar year, Lessor shall provide Lessee an accounting showing in reasonable detail
all computations of additional rent due under this Section. In the event the accounting shows that the total of the monthly payments made by Lessee exceeds the amount of additional rent due by Lessee under this Section, such amount shall be refunded
to Lessee. In the event the accounting shows that the total of the monthly payments made by Lessee is less than the amount of additional rent due by Lessee under this Section, the account shall be accompanied by an invoice for the additional rent.
If this Lease shall terminate on a day other than the last day of a calendar year, the amount of any additional rent payable by Lessee applicable to the year in which such termination shall occur shall be prorated on the ratio that the number of
days from the commencement of the calendar year to and including the termination date bears to 365. Provided Lessee is not in default of any terms of this Lease, Lessee shall have the right, at its own expense, to audit Lessors books relevant
to the additional rent payable under this Section. With respect to such audit, Lessee (i) may review Lessors books during office hours, (ii) must perform such audit at the location of Lessors books; provided, however, Lessor
must provide a location within Texas to review same if its books are otherwise held outside of the United States, (iii) must request such audit within three (3) years of receipt of its annual reconciliation of Operating Expenses,
(iv) must deliver to Lessor a copy of the results of such audit, and (v) may not audit the same calendar year more than one time. If, as a result of such audit, it is determined that the Operating Expenses have been overstated by three
percent (3%) or more, Lessor shall be required to reimburse Lessee for the costs of such audit within thirty (30) days of receipt of written request therefore. Assignees of Lessee may only audit periods for which they occupy the Leased
Premises and subtenants of Lessee shall have no audit rights. Lessee agrees to pay any additional rent due under this Section within thirty (30) days following receipt of the invoice or accounting showing additional rent due. 
2.04 Definition of Operating Expenses. The term Operating Expenses includes all actual and reasonable expenses as
compared to comparable buildings in the area as incurred by Lessor with respect to the maintenance and operation of the Building, including, but not limited to, the following: a management fee not to exceed

 






COMMERCIAL LEASE
  
Page 4



two percent (2%) of gross rental income per annum (see maintenance, repair and replacement costs (excluding capital costs and Lessors cost for maintenance of the roof, foundation and
structural soundness of the exterior walls of the building, mechanical, electrical and plumbing systems service of the Building and common areas as provided in Section 5.02 hereof); wages and benefits payable to employees of Lessor to the
extent their duties are directly connected with the operation and maintenance of the Building; all services, utilities for common areas, supplies, repairs, replacement or other expenses for maintaining and operating the parking areas; the cost,
amortized over its useful life, of any expense required to be capitalized under GAAP principles and any capital improvement made to the Building by Lessor after the date of this Lease which are required under any governmental law or regulation; and
the cost, amortized over its useful life, of installation of any device or other equipment to the extent it improves the operating efficiency of any system within the Leased Premises and thereby reduces Operating Expenses, provided that, prior to
installing any such device or equipment Lessor will inform Lessee of such installation and the estimated cost savings. The term Operating Expenses does not include the following: income and franchise taxes of Lessor; expenses incurred in leasing to
or procuring of lessees, leasing commissions, advertising expenses and expenses for the renovating of space for new lessees; interest or principal payments on any mortgage or other indebtedness of lessor; compensation paid to any employee of Lessor
other than maintenance and property management personnel to the extent these services are directly associated with the operation and maintenance of the Building; any depreciation allowance or expense (except for depreciation of capital improvements
and equipment specifically included within the definition of Operating Expenses); or operating expenses which are the responsibility of Lessee or any other lessee of the Building; or expenses (herein called Defect Expenses)
incurred as a result of or caused by latent defects, punch list items, or Lessors failure to construct the Lessee Improvements (hereinafter defined) in accordance with the requirements of this Lease and Lessee Improvements Final Plans and
Specifications as provided herein (such items being herein called Defects); operating expenses otherwise caused by or resulting from Lessors breach of its obligations under this Lease; rent payable by Lessor pursuant to any
ground lease; except as provided above with respect to capital improvements, costs relating to violation of law; costs relating to late payment of taxes; Lessors administrative overhead (except as provided herein as related to the Building);
and costs relating to the presence of hazardous materials at the Building prior to the date hereof.  2.05 Late Payment Charge.
Other remedies for nonpayment of rent notwithstanding, if the monthly rental payment is not received by Lessor on or before the tenth (10th) day of the month for which the rent is due, or if
any other payment due Lessor by Lessee is not received by Lessor on or before the tenth (10th) day of the month next following the month in which Lessee was invoiced, Lessee agrees to pay a late payment charge of two percent (2%) of such
past due amount in addition to such amounts owed under this Lease. In addition, Lessor is entitled to charge One Hundred Dollars ($100.00) for each check or payment which is not honored by Lessees bank. Said charge is in addition to any other
amounts owed under this Lease.

2.06 Security Deposit. The security deposit set forth above will be held by Lessor for the
performance of Lessees covenants and obligations under this Lease, it being expressly understood that the deposit is not an advance payment of rental or a measure of Lessors damage in case of default by Lessee. Upon the occurrence of any
event of default by Lessee or breach by Lessee of Lessees covenants under this Lease and continuance of same beyond any applicable cure period, Lessor may, from time to time, without prejudice to any other remedy, use the security deposit to
the extent necessary to make good any arrears of rent, or to repair any damage or injury, or pay any expense or liability incurred by Lessor as a result of the event of default or breach of covenant, and any remaining balance of the security deposit
will be returned by Lessor to Lessee within a reasonable period of time following termination of this Lease, not to exceed thirty (30) days. If any portion of the security deposit is so used or applied, Lessee shall upon ten days written notice
from Lessor, deposit with Lessor by cash or cashiers check an amount sufficient to restore the security deposit to its original amount. 
2.07 Holding Over. In no event may Lessee remain in the Leased Premises following the expiration or termination of this Lease without
Lessors prior written consent. If Lessee does not vacate the Leased Premises upon the expiration or termination of this Lease, Lessee agrees that it will be a tenant at will for the holdover period and that all of the terms and provisions of
this Lease are applicable during that period, except that Lessee shall pay Lessor as base rental for the period of such holdover an amount equal to one and one half (1 1/2) times the base rent being paid by Lessee immediately prior to the expiration
or termination of this Lease. Lessee agrees to vacate and deliver the Leased Premises to Lessor immediately upon Lessees receipt of notice from Lessor to vacate. Such notice may be given pursuant to the notice provisions of Section 14.07
herein. Lessee agrees to pay the rental payable during the holdover period to Lessor on demand. No holding over by Lessee, whether with or without the consent of Lessor and notwithstanding receipt by Lessee of an invoice from Lessor for holdover
rent, will extend the term of this Lease. Additionally, Lessee shall pay to Lessor all damages sustained by Lessor as a result of such holding over by Lessee. 
ARTICLE 3.00 OCCUPANCY AND USE 
3.01 Use. Lessee warrants and represents to Lessor that the Leased Premises may be used and occupied only for the purpose as set forth
in Section 1.06. Lessee shall occupy the Leased Premises, conduct its business and control its agents, employees in such a manner as is lawful, reputable, will not create a nuisance, interfere with standard Building operations, or affect the
structural integrity or design capabilities of the Building. Lessee shall neither permit any waste on the Leased Premises nor allow the Leased Premises to be used in any way which would, in the reasonable opinion of Lessor, be extra hazardous on
account of fire or which would in any way render void the fire insurance on the Building. If at any time during the Term, the State Board of Insurance or other insurance authority disallows any of Lessors sprinkler credits or imposes an
additional penalty or surcharge in Lessors insurance premiums because of Lessees original or subsequent placement or use of storage racks or bins,

method of storage or nature of Lessees inventory or any other act of Lessee, Lessee agrees to pay as additional rent the increase in Lessors insurance premiums. Notwithstanding
anything set forth in this Section 3.01, in no way does Lessor warrant or represent, either expressly or impliedly, that Lessees use of the Leased Premises is in accordance with applicable codes or ordinances of the municipality within
which the Building is located. Lessee agrees to indemnify and hold Lessor harmless from all claims, demands, actions, liabilities, costs, expenses, damages and obligations of any nature arising from or as a result of the use of the Leased Premises
by Lessee. The foregoing indemnification and the responsibilities of Lessee survive the termination or expiration of this Lease.  3.02
Signs. No sign of any type or description may be erected, placed or painted in or about the Leased Premises or Building, including those advertising the Leased Premises for sublease, except those signs submitted to Lessor in writing and approved

COMMERCIAL LEASE
  
Page 14



such alterations or improvements. Any alterations, physical additions or improvements to the Leased Premises (including Lessee Improvements) made by Lessor or Lessee become the property of Lessor
and must be surrendered to Lessor upon the termination of this Lease without credit to Lessee; provided, however, Lessor, at its option, may require Lessee to remove any physical additions and/or repair any alterations in order to restore the Leased

Lessor agrees at the time of approval thereof that they do not have to be so removed. This clause does not apply to moveable equipment or furniture owned by Lessee, which may be removed by Lessee at the end of the term of this Lease if Lessee is not
then in default, if such equipment and furniture are not then subject to any other rights, liens and interest of Lessor and such removal can be accomplished without material damage to the Leased Premises and, if there shall exist any damage caused

balance upon completion thereof.  6.03 Mechanics Lien. Lessee will not permit any mechanics or materialmans lien(s) or
other lien to be placed upon the Leased Premises or the Building and nothing in this Lease is intended in any way to constitute the consent by (or request of) Lessor, express or implied, by inference or otherwise, to any person for the performance
of any labor or the furnishing of any materials to the Leased Premises, or any part that would give the rise to any mechanics or materialmans or other lien against the Leased Premises. In the event any such lien attaches to the Leased
Premises as a result of Lessees actions, then, in addition to any other right or remedy of Lessor, Lessor may, but is not obligated to, obtain the release or otherwise discharge the same after ten (10) days notice to Lessee and
opportunity to cure same. Any actual amounts paid by Lessor for any of the aforesaid purposes must be paid by Lessee to Lessor on demand as additional rent.

respective partys failure to perform its design approval obligations by the dates or within the time periods set forth herein or its construction period obligations by the dates or within the time periods shown in Sections 6.01 or 6.04 of this
Lease; and  (ii) Any subsequent changes, modifications, or alterations to the Final Lessee Improvements Plans and
Specifications which reasonably cause delay in the completion thereof.  Lessee Delay or Delays caused by
Lessee shall also mean delays due to the scope and extent of the Lessee Improvements to be constructed by Lessor. For purposes of determining Lessee Delay under this Section 6.04(c), the Lessor must provide notice to Lessee of the
existence of excessive Lessee Improvements, special design or construction considerations or other matters which will extend the time necessary for the construction of the Lessee Improvements beyond two (2) days; such notice to be provided by

ARTICLE 7.00 CASUALTY AND INSURANCE 
7.01 Substantial Destruction. If the Leased Premises or any part thereof are damaged by fire or other casualty, Lessee shall give
prompt written notice thereof to Lessor after Lessees actual knowledge of same, (i) If the Leased Premises are totally destroyed by fire or other casualty, (ii) if the Leased Premises are damaged so that rebuilding cannot reasonably
be commenced within sixty (60) days and completed within one hundred eighty (180) days after the date of written notification by Lessee to Lessor of the destruction, (iii) if the Leased Premises are part of a building which is
substantially destroyed (even though the Leased Premises are not totally or substantially destroyed), (iv) if the Leased Premises or Building is damaged by fire or other casualty and applicable law would prevent rebuilding to substantially the
condition prior to such fire or casualty, (v) if any mortgagee requires the insurance proceeds payable as a result of such casualty to be applied to the payment of the mortgage debt or (vi) if the Leased Premises are materially damaged and
less than two (2) years remain on the Term on the date of such casualty, Lessor or Lessee may terminate this Lease by providing written notice to the other party within sixty (60) days of notice of such casualty. 
7.02 Partial Destruction. If this Lease is not terminated under Section 7.01, Lessor shall, at its sole risk and expense, proceed
with reasonable diligence to rebuild or repair the Building or other improvements to substantially the same condition in which they existed prior to the damage, provided, Lessor has no obligation to repair or rebuild Lessees furniture,
fixtures or personal property. If the destruction was caused by an act or omission of Lessee, its employees, agents, or invitees, Lessee shall pay Lessor the difference between the actual cost of rebuilding or repairing the Leased Premises and any
insurance proceeds received by Lessor. If the Leased Premises are to be rebuilt or repaired and are untenantable in whole or in part following the damage, and the damage or destruction was not caused or contributed to by any act or negligence of
Lessee, its agents, employees, invitees or those for whom Lessee is responsible, the rent payable under this Lease during the period for which the Leased Premises are untenantable will be adjusted to such an extent as may be fair and reasonable
under the circumstances. If Lessor fails to complete the necessary repairs or rebuilding within a reasonable time following Lessors receipt of notice of such casualty (not to exceed one hundred fifty (150) days from the date of written
notification by Lessee to Lessor of the destruction), Lessee may at its option terminate this Lease by delivering written notice of termination to Lessor, whereupon all rights and obligations under this Lease cease to exist. If any damage or
destruction occurs to the Leased Premises during the last twenty-four (24) months of the term of this Lease, Lessor or Lessee may elect to terminate this Lease as of the date Lessee notifies Lessor of such damage. Lessor and Lessee hereby waive
the provisions of any law from time to time in effect during the Term relating to the effect upon leases of partial or total destruction of Leased property and agree that their respective rights in the event of damage or destruction are those
specifically set forth herein.

7.03 Property Insurance. Lessor shall, at all times during the term of this Lease,
maintain a policy or policies of insurance with the premiums paid in advance, issued by and binding upon some solvent insurance company qualified to do business in Texas, insuring the Building against all risk of direct physical loss in an amount
equal to the full replacement cost of the Building structure and its improvements as of the date of the loss (exclusive of excavation and foundation costs, costs of underground items and costs of parking lot paving and landscaping), providing
protection against all perils, including, without limitations fire, extended coverage, vandalism, malicious mischief, a standard mortgagee clause and rental coverage; provided, Lessor is not obligated in any way or manner to insure any personal
property (including, but not limited to, any furniture, machinery, goods or supplies) of Lessee upon or within the Leased Premises, any fixtures installed or paid for by Lessee upon or within the Leased Premises, or any improvements which Lessee may
construct on the Leased Premises. The rental insurance policy will be for the full rental value for a period of one year, which insurance also covers real estate taxes, insurance and other amounts which might be due Lessor from Lessee pursuant to
the terms of this Lease. Lessee agrees that it is not entitled to the proceeds of any policy of insurance maintained by Lessor even if the cost of such insurance is borne by Lessee as set forth in Article 2.00. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the
event Lessor has a net worth in excess of $50,000,000, it shall be entitled to self insure against all risk provided for in this paragraph in lieu of obtaining the insurance set forth herein. 
7.04 Waiver of Subrogation. ANYTHING IN THIS LEASE TO THE CONTRARY NOT WITHSTANDING, LESSOR AND LESSEE HEREBY WAIVE AND RELEASE EACH
OTHER OF AND FROM ANY AND ALL RIGHT OF RECOVERY, CLAIM, ACTION OR CAUSE OF ACTION, AGAINST EACH OTHER, THEIR AGENTS, OFFICERS AND EMPLOYEES, FOR ANY LOSS OR DAMAGE THAT MAY OCCUR TO THE LEASED PREMISES, IMPROVEMENTS TO THE BUILDING OF WHICH THE
LEASED PREMISES ARE A PART, OR PERSONAL PROPERTY WITHIN THE BUILDING, BY REASON OF FIRE, EXPLOSION, OR ANY OTHER OCCURRENCE, REGARDLESS OF CAUSE OR ORIGIN, INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OF LESSOR OR LESSEE AND THEIR AGENTS, OFFICERS AND EMPLOYEES. LESSOR AND
LESSEE AGREE IMMEDIATELY TO GIVE THEIR RESPECTIVE INSURANCE COMPANIES WHICH HAVE ISSUED POLICIES OF INSURANCE COVERING ALL RISK OF DIRECT PHYSICAL LOSS, WRITTEN NOTICE OF THE TERMS OF THE MUTUAL WAIVERS CONTAINED IN THIS SECTION AND TO HAVE THE
INSURANCE POLICIES PROPERLY ENDORSED, IF NECESSARY, TO PREVENT THE INVALIDATION OF THE INSURANCE COVERAGE BY REASON OF THE MUTUAL WAIVERS. 
7.05 Hold Harmless. Lessor will not be liable to Lessees employees, agents, invitees, licensees or visitors, or to any other
person, for any injury to person or damage to property on or about the Leased Premises caused by any act or omission of Lessee, its agents, servants or employees, any tenant in the Building of which the Leased Premises are a part, or of any other
person entering upon the Leased Premises under express or implied invitation by Lessee, or the failure or cessation of any service provided by Lessor (including security service and devices or caused by leakage of gas,

oil, water or steam or by electricity emanating from the Leased Premises). Lessee agrees to indemnify and hold harmless Lessor of and from any loss, attorneys fees, expenses or claims
arising out of any such damage or injury. LESSEE ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ITS INDEMNITY OBLIGATIONS HEREUNDER COVER AND RELATE TO, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY NEGLIGENT ACTION AND/OR OMISSION (WHETHER JOINT, COMPARATIVE OR CONCURRENT) OF LESSOR AND
LESSORS AGENTS, SERVANTS AND EMPLOYEES. Lessor agrees to use its best efforts to contract with third parties which carry a general liability insurance coverage. 
7.06 Lessee Insurance. 
(a) At all times commencing on and after the earlier of the Commencement Date and the date Lessee or its agents, employees or
contractors enters the Leased Premises for any purpose, Lessee shall carry and maintain, at its sole cost and expense:  (i)
Commercial General Liability Insurance applicable to the Leased Premises and its appurtenances providing, on an occurrence basis, a minimum combined single limit of Two Million Dollars ($2,000,000.00), with a contractual liability endorsement
covering Lessees indemnity obligations under this Lease;  (ii) All Risks of Physical Loss Insurance written at
replacement cost value and with a replacement cost endorsement covering all of Lessees personal property and improvements in the Leased Premises; 
(iii) Workers Compensation Insurance as required by the state in which the Leased Premises is located and in amounts as
may be required by applicable statute, and Employers Liability Coverage of One Million Dollars ($1,000,000.00) per occurrence; 
(iv) Whenever good business practice, in Lessors reasonable judgment, indicates the need of additional insurance coverage
or different types of insurance in connection with the Leased Premises or Lessees use and occupancy thereof, Lessee shall, upon request, obtain such insurance at Lessees expense and provide Lessor with evidence thereof. 
(b) Before any repairs, alterations, additions, improvements, or construction are undertaken by or on behalf of Lessee, Lessee
shall carry and maintain, at its expense, or Lessee shall require any contractor performing work on the Leased Premises to carry and maintain, at no expense to Lessor, in addition to Workers Compensation Insurance as required by the
jurisdiction in which the Building is located, All Risk Builders Risk Insurance in the amount of the replacement cost of any alterations, additions or improvements and Commercial General Liability Insurance (including, without limitation,
Contractors Liability coverage, Contractual Liability coverage and Completed Operations

coverage,) written on an occurrence basis with a minimum combined single limit of Two Million Dollars ($2,000,000.00) and adding the named Lessor hereunder (or any successor thereto), and
its respective members, principals, beneficiaries, partners, officers, directors, employees, agents and any Mortgagee(s), and other designees of Lessor as the interest of such designees appear, as additional insureds (collectively referred to
as the Additional Insureds).  (c) Any company writing any insurance which Lessee is required to maintain
or cause to be maintained pursuant to the terms of this Lease (all such insurance as well as any other insurance pertaining to the Leased Premises or the operation of Lessees business therein being referred to as Lessees
Insurance), as well as the form of such insurance, are at all times subject to Lessors reasonable approval, and each such insurance company must have an A.M. Best rating of A- or better and be licensed and qualified to do
business in the state in which the Leased Premises are located. All policies evidencing Lessees Insurance (except for Workers Compensation Insurance) must specify Lessee as named insured and the Additional Insureds as additional
insureds. Provided that the coverage afforded Lessor and any designees of Lessor is not reduced or otherwise adversely affected, all of Lessees Insurance may be carried under a blanket policy covering the Leased Premises and any other of
Lessees locations. All policies of Lessees Insurance must contain endorsements requiring that the insurer(s) give Lessor and its designees at least thirty (30) days advance written notice of any change, cancellation,
termination or lapse of said insurance. Lessee shall be solely responsible for payment of premiums for all of Lessees Insurance. Lessee shall deliver to Lessor at least fifteen (15) days prior to the time Lessees Insurance is first
required to be carried by Lessee, and upon renewals at least fifteen (15) days prior to the expiration of any such insurance coverage, certified copies of all policies procured by Lessee in compliance with its obligations under this Lease. The
limits of Lessees Insurance do not in any manner limit Lessees liability under this Lease.  (d) Lessee shall
not do or fail to do anything in, upon or about the Leased Premises which will (i) violate the terms of any of Lessors insurance policies; (ii) prevent Lessor from obtaining policies of insurance acceptable to Lessor or any
Mortgagees; or (iii) result in an increase in the rate of any insurance on the Leased Premises, the Building, any other property of Lessor or of others within the Building. In the event of the occurrence of any of the events set forth in this
Section, Lessee shall pay Lessor upon demand, as additional rent, the cost of the amount of any increase in any such insurance premium, provided that the acceptance by Lessor of such payment may not be construed to be a waiver of any rights by
Lessor in connection with a default by Lessee under this Lease. If Lessee fails to obtain the insurance coverage required by this Lease, Lessor may, at its option and after notice to Lessee and a reasonable opportunity to cure, obtain such insurance
for Lessee, and Lessee shall pay, as additional rent, the cost of all premiums thereon and all of Lessors costs associated therewith.

ARTICLE 8.00 CONDEMNATION 
8.01 Substantial Taking. If all or a substantial portion of the Leased Premises or a substantial portion of the Building of which the
Leased Premises are a part (even though the Leased Premises are not taken) are taken for any public or quasi-public use under any governmental law, ordinance or regulation, or by right of eminent domain or by purchase in lieu thereof, or the taking
would prevent or materially interfere with the use of the Leased Premises or the Building of which the Leased Premises are a part for the purpose for which it is then being used, then Lessor and Lessee have the option to terminate this Lease and to
abate the rent during the unexpired portion of this Lease effective on the date title or physical possession is taken by the condemning authority, whichever occurs first. All proceeds of any taking are the sole property of Lessor and Lessee agrees
that Lessee is not entitled to any condemnation award or proceeds in lieu thereof (but may maintain a separate action for damages). 
8.02 Partial Taking. If a portion of the Leased Premises or a portion of the Building of which the Leased Premises are a part are taken
for any public or quasi-public use under any governmental law, ordinance or regulation, or by right of eminent domain or by purchase in lieu thereof, and this Lease is not terminated as provided in Section 8.01 above, Lessor shall at
Lessors sole risk and expense, restore and reconstruct the Building and other improvements on the Leased Premises to the extent necessary to make it substantially similar in terms of appearance and functionality; provided, if the damages
received by Lessor are insufficient to cover the costs of restoration, Lessor may terminate this Lease. The rent payable under this Lease during the unexpired portion of the term will be adjusted to such an extent as may be fair and reasonable under
the circumstances. All proceeds of any taking are the sole property of Lessor and Lessee agrees that Lessee is not entitled to any condemnation award or proceeds in lieu thereof (but may maintain a separate action for damages). 
ARTICLE 9.00 ASSIGNMENT OR SUBLEASE 
9.01 Lessor Assignment. Lessor may sell, transfer or assign, in whole or in part, its rights and obligations under this Lease and in
the Leased Premises. Any such sale, transfer or assignment will release Lessor from any and all liabilities under this Lease arising after the date of such sale, assignment or transfer. 
9.02 Lessee Assignment. Lessee shall not assign, in whole or in part, this Lease, or allow it to be assigned, in whole or in part, by
operation of law or otherwise (including without limitation, if Lessees voting securities are not traded on any national securities exchange, by transfer of more than a twenty five percent (25%) interest in Lessee in a single transaction
or in a series of transactions, which transfer will be deemed an assignment) or mortgage or pledge the same or sublet the Leased Premises, in whole or in part, without the prior written consent of Lessor which consent may not be unreasonably
withheld, conditions or delayed, in Lessors sole discretion, be withheld, and in no event will any such assignment or sublease ever release Lessee or any guarantor from any obligation or liability hereunder. Lessee may assign, in whole or in
part, this Lease to an affiliate without the prior written consent of Lessor; provided,  
 






COMMERCIAL LEASE
  
Page 21



however, such assignee must be of the same or better credit risk as Lessee and of the same or similar type of business as Lessee. It shall not be deemed an assignment in the event Lessees
stock becomes publicly traded or Lessees business is sold. No assignee or sublessee of the Leased Premises or any portion thereof may assign or sublet the Leased Premises or any portion thereof. 
9.03 Conditions of Assignment. If Lessee desires to assign or sublet all or any part of the Leased Premises or grant any license,
concession or other right of occupancy of any portion of the Leased Premises, it must so notify Lessor at least thirty days in advance of the date on which Lessee desires to make such assignment or sublease; provided, however, Lessee is permitted to
sublet all or any part of the Leased Premises to Celeste Optics, Inc., or Optical Regen, Inc., with which it has a working relationship, without the prior written consent of Lessor. Lessee must provide Lessor with a copy of the proposed assignment
or sublease and such information as Lessor might reasonably request concerning the proposed sublessee or assignee to allow Lessor to make informed judgments as to the financial condition, reputation, operations and general desirability of the
proposed sublessee or assignee. Within fifteen days after Lessors receipt of Lessees proposed assignment or sublease and all required information concerning the proposed sublessee or assignee, Lessor may, in its sole and absolute
discretion, either: (i) consent to the proposed assignment or sublease, pursuant to a Consent Agreement on a form approved by Lessor in its sole discretion, and, if the rent due and payable by any assignee or sublessee under any such permitted
assignment or sublease (or a combination of the rent payable under such assignment or sublease plus any bonus or any other consideration or any payment incident thereto) exceeds the rent payable under this Lease for such space, Lessee shall pay to
Lessor all such excess rent and other excess consideration within ten days following receipt thereof by Lessee; or (ii) refuse to consent to the proposed assignment or sublease, which refusal is deemed to have been exercised unless Lessor gives
Lessee written notice providing otherwise. Upon the occurrence of an event of default, if all or any part of the Leased Premises are then assigned or sublet, Lessor, in addition to any other remedies provided by this Lease or provided by law, may,
at its option, collect directly from the assignee or sublessee all rents becoming due to Lessee by reason of the assignment or sublease. Lessee agrees that any collection directly by Lessor from the assignee or sublessee is not intended to
constitute a novation or a release of Lessee or any guarantor from the further performance of its obligations under this Lease. As a condition to Lessors review of any assignment or sublease, Lessee must deliver to Lessor a non-refundable fee
of $500.00 to defer Lessors administrative costs with respect thereto. In addition, all legal fees and expenses, not to exceed $1,000, incurred by Lessor in connection with the review by Lessor of Lessees requested assignment or sublease
together with any legal fees and disbursements incurred in the preparation and/or review of any documentation required by the requested assignment or sublease, are the responsibility of Lessee and must be paid by Lessee within five (5) days of
demand for payment thereof.  9.04 Subordination. Lessee accepts this Lease subject and subordinate to any recorded mortgage
or deed of trust lien presently existing or hereafter created upon the Building or project of which the Leased Premises are a part (provided, however, that  
 






COMMERCIAL LEASE
  
Page 22



any such mortgagee may, at any time, subordinate such mortgage, deed of trust or other lien to this Lease) and to all existing recorded restrictions, covenants, easements and agreements with
respect to the Building and to any renewals thereof. Lessee agrees to provide Lessor with a non-disturbance agreement substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit E within thirty (30) days of execution of this
Lease. If the interests of Lessor under this Lease are transferred by reason of foreclosure or other proceedings for enforcement of any first mortgage or deed of trust lien on the Leased Premises, Lessee is bound to the transferee (sometimes called
the Purchaser) at the option of the Purchaser, under the terms, covenants and conditions of this Lease for the balance of the term remaining, including any extensions or renewals, with the same force and effect as if the Purchaser
were Lessor under this Lease, and, if requested by the Purchaser, Lessee agrees to attorn to the Purchaser, including the first mortgagee under any such mortgage if it be the Purchaser, as its Lessor. Should Purchaser elect to maintain existence of
this Lease, Lessee will not be entitled to any credits as against Purchaser any prepaid rents or offsets against or credits due from Lessor. 
9.05 Estoppel Certificates. Lessee agrees to furnish, from time to time, within ten (10) days after receipt of a request from
Lessor, Lessors mortgagee or any potential purchaser of the Building, a statement certifying, if applicable, the following: Lessee is in possession of the Leased Premises; the Leased Premises are acceptable; this Lease is in full force and
effect; this Lease is unmodified; Lessee claims no present charge, lien, or claim of offset against rent; the rent is paid for the current month, but is not prepaid for more than one month and will not be prepaid for more than one month in advance;
there is no existing default by reason of some act or omission by Lessor; and such other matters as may be reasonably required by Lessor, Lessors mortgagee or any potential purchaser. Lessees failure to deliver such statement, in
addition to being a default under this Lease, may be deemed to establish conclusively that this Lease is in full force and effect except as declared by Lessor, that Lessor is not in default of any of its obligations under this Lease and that Lessor
has not received more than one months rent in advance. Any notice and cure provisions set forth in any other part of this Lease does not apply to a default of this Section 9.05. Lessor agrees to furnish a similar estoppel certificate
within ten (10) days after receipt of a request from Lessee.  ARTICLE 10.00 LIENS 
10.01 Landlords Lien. This section intentionally deleted. 
10.02 Uniform Commercial Code. This section intentionally deleted. 
10.03 Statutory Lien. Lessor hereby waives any statutory lien against Lessee. 
ARTICLE 11.00 DEFAULT AND REMEDIES 
11.01 Default by Lessee. The following are events of default by Lessee under this Lease: 
(a) Lessee fails to pay, when due, any installment of rent or any other payment required pursuant to this Lease, and such
failure continues for a period 
 






COMMERCIAL LEASE
  
Page 23



of ten (10) days following written notice from Lessor to Lessee; provided Lessor shall not be obligated to provide such notice more than twice in any twelve month period; 
(b) Lessee fails to comply with any term, provision or covenant of this Lease, other than the payment of rent, and such failure
continues for a period of thirty (30) days following written notice from Lessor to Lessee; provided, however, if the nature of Lessees default is such that more than thirty (30) days are reasonably required for its cure, then Lessee
shall not be deemed to be in default if Lessee shall commence such cure with said thirty (30) day period and thereafter diligently pursues same to completion; 
(c) Lessee or any guarantor of Lessees obligations hereunder files a petition or is adjudged bankrupt or insolvent under
any applicable federal or state bankruptcy or insolvency law, or admits that it cannot meet its financial obligations as they become due; or a receiver or trustee is appointed for all or substantially all of the assets of Lessee or such guarantor;
or Lessee or any guarantor of Lessees obligations hereunder makes a transfer in fraud of creditors or makes an assignment for the benefit of creditors; or 
11.02 Remedies for Lessees Default. Upon the occurrence of any event of default set forth in this Lease, Lessor is entitled to
pursue any one or more of the remedies set forth herein without any notice or demand.  (a) Without declaring this
Lease terminated, Lessor may enter upon and take possession of the Leased Premises, by picking or changing locks if necessary, and lock out, expel or remove Lessee and any other person who may be occupying all or any part of the Leased Premises
without being liable for any claim for damages, and relet the Leased Premises on behalf of Lessee and receive the rent directly by reason of the reletting; provided however, that Lessor has no obligation to relet the Leased Premises so as to
mitigate the amount for which Lessee is liable. Lessee agrees to pay Lessor on demand any deficiency that may arise by reason of any reletting of the Leased Premises; further, Lessee agrees to reimburse Lessor for any expenditures made by it in
order to relet the Leased Premises, including, but not limited to, leasing commissions, lease incentives, remodeling and repair costs. 
(b) Without declaring this Lease terminated, Lessor may enter upon the Leased Premises, by picking or changing locks if
necessary, without being liable for any claim for damages, and do whatever Lessee is obligated to do under the terms of this Lease. Lessee agrees to reimburse Lessor on demand for any expenses which Lessor may incur in effecting compliance with
Lessees obligations under this Lease; further, Lessee agrees that Lessor will not be liable for any damages resulting to Lessee from effecting compliance with Lessees obligations under this Lease caused by the negligence of Lessor or
otherwise. 
 






COMMERCIAL LEASE
  
Page 24


(c) Lessor may terminate this Lease, in which event Lessee shall immediately
surrender the Leased Premises to Lessor, and if Lessee fails to surrender the Leased Premises, Lessor may, without prejudice to any other remedy which it may have for possession or arrearages in rent, enter upon and take possession of the Leased
Premises, by picking or changing locks if necessary, and lock out, expel or remove Lessee and any other person who may be occupying all or any part of the Leased Premises without being liable for any claim for damages. Lessee agrees to pay on demand
the amount of all loss and damage which Lessor may suffer by reason of the termination of this Lease under this Section, including without limitation, loss and damage due to the failure of Lessee to maintain and or repair the Leased Premises as
required hereunder and/or due to the inability to relet the Leased Premises on terms satisfactory to Lessor or otherwise, and any expenditures made by Lessor in order to relet the Leased Premises, including, but not limited to, leasing commissions,
lease incentives, and remodeling and repair costs; provided however, that Lessor will have no obligation to relet the Leased Premises so as to mitigate the amount for which Lessee is liable. In addition, upon termination Lessor may collect from
Lessee the value of all future rentals required to be paid under this Lease from the date Lessor terminates this Lease until the original termination date in accordance with applicable law. Notwithstanding anything contained in this Lease to the
contrary, this Lease may be terminated by Lessor only by mailing or delivering written notice of such termination to Lessee, and no other act or omission of Lessor constitutes a termination of this Lease. 
(d) In the event that Lessor exercises its remedy to lock out Lessee in accordance with any provision of this Lease, Lessee
agrees that no notice is required to be posted by Lessor on any door to the Leased Premises (or elsewhere) disclosing the reason for such action or any other information, and that Lessor is not obligated to provide a key to the changed lock to
Lessee unless Lessee has first:  (i) brought current all payments due to Lessor under this Lease (unless Lessor has
permanently repossessed the Leased Premises or terminated this Lease, in which event payment of all past due amounts do not obligate Lessor to provide a key); 
(ii) fully cured and remedied to Lessors satisfaction all other defaults of Lessee under this Lease (unless Lessee has
abandoned or vacated the Leased Premises, in which event Lessor is not obligated to provide the new key to Lessee under any circumstances); and 
(iii) provided Lessor with additional security deposit and assurances satisfactory to Lessor that Lessee intends to and is able
to meet and comply with its future obligations under this Lease, both monetary and non-monetary. Lessor may, upon written request by Lessee, at Lessors convenience, upon receipt by Lessor of an amount necessary to reimburse itself for time and
expense in providing such service, and upon Lessees execution and delivery of such waivers and indemnities as Lessor may require at Lessors option either: 
 






COMMERCIAL LEASE
  
Page 25


a) escort Lessee or its specifically authorized employees or agents to the
Leased Premises to retrieve personal belongings of Lessees employees and property of Lessee that is not subject to a Security Interest provided in this Lease; or 
b) obtain from Lessee a list of such property and arrange for such items to be removed from the Leased Premises and made
available to Lessee at such place at such time as Lessor may designate, provided however, that if Lessor elects option (ii), then Lessee shall pay Lessor in cash in advance, the estimated costs that Lessor may incur upon moving and storage charges
theretofore incurred by Lessor with respect to such property. THE PROVISIONS OF THIS ARTICLE ARE INTENDED TO OVERRIDE AND SUPERSEDE ANY CONFLICTING PROVISIONS OF THE TEXAS PROPERTY CODE AND ANY AMENDMENTS OR SUCCESSOR STATUTES THERETO, AND OF ANY
OTHER LAW, TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY THE LAW.  (e) Notwithstanding any other remedy set forth in this Lease, if
Lessor has made rent concessions of any type or character, or waived any base rent (i.e. given free rent), and Lessee fails to take possession of the Leased Premises on the Commencement Date or otherwise defaults at any time during the term of this
Lease, the rent concessions, including any waived base rent, are canceled and the amount of the base rent or other rent concessions are due and payable immediately as if no rent concessions or waiver of any base rent had ever been granted. A rent
concession or waiver of the base rent will not relieve Lessee of any obligation to pay any other charge due and payable under this Lease including without limitation any sums due under Section 2.02 herein. 
(f) If Lessor exercises any of its rights provided herein and Lessee subsequently cures such default, Lessor is entitled to
receive a service charge of $500.00 from Lessee for its time and expense, in addition to any other amounts owed hereunder, prior to allowing the Lessee to reenter and reoccupy the Leased Premises. 
(g) Lessee hereby expressly waives any and all rights of redemption granted by or under any present or future laws in the event
of Lessee being evicted or dispossessed for any cause, or in the event of Lessor obtaining possession of the Leased Premises by reason of the violation by Lessee of any of the covenants and conditions of this Lease or otherwise. The rights given to
Lessor herein are in addition to any rights that may be given to Lessor by any statute or otherwise. 
 






COMMERCIAL LEASE
  
Page 26


(h) Lessors pursuit of any remedy specified in this Lease will not
constitute an election to pursue that remedy only, nor preclude Lessor from pursuing any other remedy available at law or in equity, nor constitute a forfeiture or waiver of any rent or other amount due to Lessor as described herein. 
(i) If Lessee or any guarantor of Lessees obligations hereunder is the subject of any insolvency, bankruptcy,
receivership, dissolution, reorganization or similar proceeding, federal or state, voluntary or involuntary, under any present or future law or act, Lessor is entitled to the automatic and absolute lifting of any automatic stay as to the enforcement
of its remedies under this Lease, including specifically the stay imposed by Section 362 of the United States Federal Bankruptcy Code, as amended. Lessee hereby consents to the immediate lifting of any such automatic stay, and may not contest
any motion by Lessor to lift such stay. Lessee expressly acknowledges that the Leased Premises is not now and will never be necessary to any plan or reorganization of any type. 
11.03 Lessors Liability. The liability of Lessor to Lessee for any default by Lessor under the terms of this Lease is limited to
Lessees actual direct, but not consequential, damages therefor and is recoverable only from the interest of Lessor in the Building, and Lessor is not personally liable for any deficiency. 
ARTICLE 12.00 RELOCATION 
12.01 Relocation Option. This section intentionally deleted. 
ARTICLE 13.00 DEFINITIONS 
13.01 Abandon. Abandon means the vacating of all or a substantial portion of the Leased Premises by Lessee or any
approved sublessee, whether or not Lessee or any approved sublessee is in default of the rental payments due under this Lease. 
13.02 Building. Building as used in this Lease means the building described in Section 1.02, including the
Leased Premises and the land upon which the Building is situated.  13.03 Commencement Date. Commencement
Date is the date set forth in Section 1.03. The Commencement Date constitutes the commencement of the term of this Lease for all purposes, whether or not Lessee has actually taken possession. 
13.04 Square Feet. Square feet or square foot as used in this Lease includes the area contained
within the Leased Premises.  ARTICLE 14.00 MISCELLANEOUS 
14.01 Waiver. Failure of Lessor to declare an event of default immediately upon its occurrence, or delay in taking any action in
connection with an event of default, will not constitute a waiver of the default, but Lessor has the right to declare the default at any time and take such action as is lawful or authorized under this Lease. Pursuit of 

 






COMMERCIAL LEASE
  
Page 27



any one or more of the remedies set forth in Article 11.00 or Article 12.00 above will not preclude pursuit of any one or more of the other remedies provided elsewhere in this Lease or
provided at law or in equity, nor will pursuit of any remedy constitute forfeiture or waiver of any rent or damages accruing to Lessor by reason of the violation of any of the terms, provisions or covenants of this Lease. Lessee agrees that failure
by Lessor to enforce one or more of the remedies provided upon an event of default will not constitute a waiver of the default or of any other violation or breach of any of the terms, provisions and covenants contained in this Lease. 
No act or thing done by Lessor or its agents during the term of this Lease may be deemed an acceptance of an attempted surrender of the Leased
Premises, and no agreement to accept a surrender of the Leased Premises will be valid unless made in writing and signed by Lessor. No reentry or taking possession of the Leased Premises by Lessor may be construed as an election on its part to
terminate this Lease, unless a written notice of such intention, signed by Lessor, is given by Lessor to Lessee. Notwithstanding any such reletting or reentry or taking possession, Lessor may at any time thereafter elect to terminate this Lease for
a previous event of default. Lessee and Lessor agree that Lessors acceptance of rent following an event of default hereunder will not constitute Lessors waiver of such event of default. The failure of Lessor to enforce any of the Rules
and Regulations described in Section 3.03 against Lessee or any other Lessee in the Building will not constitute a waiver of any such Rules and Regulations. No waiver of any provision of this Lease is effective unless such waiver is in writing
and signed by Lessor. All rights granted to Lessor in this Lease are cumulative of every other right or remedy which Lessor may otherwise have at law or in equity, and the exercise of one or more rights or remedies does not prejudice or impair the
concurrent or subsequent exercise of other rights or remedies.  14.02 Act of God. Lessor is not required to perform any covenant or
obligation in this Lease, or be liable in damages to Lessee, so long as the performance or non- performance of the covenant or obligation is delayed, caused or prevented by Force Majeure or by Lessee. 
14.03 Attorneys Fees. If Lessee defaults in the performance of any of the terms, covenants, agreements or conditions contained in
this Lease and Lessor places in the hands of an attorney the enforcement of all or any part of this Lease, the collection of any rent due or to become due or recovery of the possession of the Leased Premises, the prevailing party agrees to pay the
non-defaulting partys costs of collection, including reasonable attorneys fees for the services of the attorney, whether suit is actually filed or not. 
14.04 Successors. This Lease is binding upon and inures to the benefit of Lessor and Lessee and their respective heirs, personal
representatives, successors and assigns. It is hereby covenanted and agreed that should Lessors interest in the Leased Premises cease to exist for any reason during the term of this Lease, then notwithstanding the happening of such event this
Lease nevertheless will remain unimpaired and in full force and effect, and Lessee hereunder agrees to attorn to the then owner of the Leased Premises.

14.05 Rent Tax. If applicable in the jurisdiction where the Leased Premises are situated,
Lessee shall pay and be liable for all rental, sales and use taxes or other similar taxes, if any, levied or imposed by any city, state, county or other governmental body having authority, such payments to be in addition to all other payments
required to be paid to Lessor by Lessee under the terms of this Lease. Any such payment must be paid concurrently with the payment of the rent, additional rent, operating expenses or other charge upon which the tax is based as set forth above.
 14.06 Captions. The captions appearing in this Lease are inserted only as a matter of convenience and in no way define, limit,

enforcement by Beneficiary of any of the terms, covenants, provisions or remedies specified in the Deed of Trust, whether or not consistent with the Lease, including (without limitation) any rights, remedies, privileges and recourses of Beneficiary
with respect to insurance proceeds and condensation awards with respect to the Demised Premises or the Property.  2. Purchaser. As used
herein, the term Purchaser shall be deemed to include Beneficiary and any of its successors and assigns, including anyone who shall have succeeded to Lessors interest in the Demised Premises by, through or under judicial
foreclosure sale, non-judicial foreclosure sale or other similar proceedings brought pursuant to the Deed of Trust, deed in lieu of such foreclosure, other proceedings brought by Beneficiary under or with respect to the Note or Deed of Trust, or
otherwise.  3. Attornment. If the interests of Lessor in and to the Demised Premises become owned by Beneficiary or another Purchaser by
reason of judicial foreclosure, non-judicial foreclosure by the trustee under the Deed of Trust, other proceedings brought by Beneficiary or Purchaser or by any other manner, including, but not limited to, Beneficiarys exercise of its rights
under any collateral assignment(s) of leases and rents, whereby Purchaser succeeds to the interest of the Lessor under the Lease, Lessee shall be bound to Purchaser in accordance with all of the terms, covenants and conditions of the Lease for the
balance of the term thereof and any extension thereof duly exercised by Lessee with the same force and effect as if Purchaser were the lessor under the Lease. Lessee does hereby attorn to Purchaser, as its lessor, which attornment shall be effective
and self-operative, without the execution of any further instruments on the part of any of the parties hereto, immediately upon Purchasers succeeding to the interest of the Lessor under the Lease; provided, however, that Lessee shall be under
no obligation to pay rent to Purchaser until Lessee receives written notice from Purchaser that it has succeeded to the interest of the Lessor under the Lease, and upon receipt of such notice, Lessee shall pay to Purchaser all rental and other
payments required under the Lease for the duration of the term of the Lease and any extensions thereof duly exercised by Lessee. The respective rights and obligations of Lessee and Purchaser upon such attornment, to the extent of the then remaining
balance of the term of the Lease and any extension thereof duly exercised, shall be and are the same as now set forth therein, as hereby amended, it being the intention of the parties hereto for this purpose to incorporate the Lease in this
Agreement by reference, with the same force and effect as if expressly set forth herein.  4. Non-Disturbance. In the event of a
foreclosure of the lien of the Deed of Trust, so long as Lessee is not in default (beyond any period given in the Lease to Lessee to cure such default) in the payment of rent or in the performance of any of the terms, covenants or conditions of the
Lease on Lessees part to be performed, Lessees

possession, use and occupancy of the Demised Premises pursuant to the Lease shall not be extinguished or terminated by such foreclosure nor interfered with or disturbed by Purchaser during the
term of the Lease and any extension thereof duly exercised by Lessee. If at, or subsequent to, the time that Purchaser shall acquire, in whatever manner, title to the Property or Lessors title or interest in the Demised Premises (subject to
the Lease), or from time to time thereafter, any default exists or occurs under the Lease, then Purchaser shall be entitled to exercise or enforce any and all rights, privileges, remedies and recourses which it may have against Lessee under or
pursuant to the Lease or other applicable law (including, without limitation, the termination of the Lease, the dispossession of Lessee from the Demised Premises, or the prosecution of an action for breach of the Lease), notwithstanding the
provisions of this Agreement.  5. Purchasers Obligations. If Purchaser shall succeed to the interest of Lessor under the Lease,
Purchaser shall be bound to Lessee under all of the terms, covenants and conditions of the Lease; provided, however, that Purchaser shall not be: 
(a) liable for any act or omission of any prior lessor (including Lessor) under the Lease; or 
(b) subject to any offsets or defenses which Lessee might have against any prior lessor (including Lessor) under the Lease; or 
(c) bound by any rent, additional rent, advance rent or other monetary obligations which Lessee might have paid for more than the current
month to any prior lessor (including Lessor) under the Lease and which is not delivered or paid to Purchaser at the time of Purchasers succession to title to the Demised Premises, and all such rent or other monetary obligations shall remain
due and owing, notwithstanding such advance payment, and with respect to which Lessee agrees to look solely to Lessor for refund or reimbursement; or 
(d) bound by any security deposit of any type or advance rental deposit made by Lessee under the Lease which is not delivered or paid to
Purchaser at the time of Purchasers succession to title to the Demised Premises, and with respect to which Lessee agrees to look solely to Lessor for refund or reimbursement; or 
(e) bound by any amendment, modification, supplementation, termination or cancellation of the Lease made without Beneficiarys or
Purchasers prior written consent and approval; or  (f) required to complete the construction of any improvements or otherwise
perform the obligations of Lessor under the Lease in the event that Purchaser acquires title to the Property prior to full completion and acceptance by Lessee of improvements required under the Lease; or 
(g) liable or responsible under or pursuant to the terms of the Lease after it ceases to own an interest in or to the Demised Premises.

restated or otherwise changed, either orally or in writing, except as herein expressly provided;  (c) all conditions or requirements
specified in the Lease that could have been satisfied as of the date hereof have been fully satisfied;  (d) no rent under the Lease has

which with notice, grace or lapse of time could constitute a default) exists under said Lease;  (f) Lessee, as of this date, has no
charge, lien, claim or offset under said Lease or otherwise against rents or other charges due or to become due under the Lease;  (g)
Purchaser shall have no liability or responsibility with respect to any security deposit or advance rental deposit made by the Lessee except to the extent actually delivered and paid to Purchaser concurrently with Purchasers succession in
interest to the Demised Premises;  (h) the only persons or entities in possession of the Demised Premises or having any right to the
possession, use or occupancy of the Demises Premises (other than the record owner or holders of recorded easements) is Lessee; and  (i)
Lessee has no right or interest in or under any contract, option or agreement (other than as shown in the Lease) involving the sale or transfer of the Demised Premises or the expansion of the Demised Premises or extension of the term of the Lease.
 7. Negative Covenants. In the absence of the prior written consent of Beneficiary (or Purchaser), Lessee agrees not to do any of the
following: (a) prepay the rent or other monetary obligations under the Lease for more than one (1) month in advance, (b) enter into any agreement, whether oral or written, with the Lessor to amend, modify, supplement, replace, restate
or otherwise change the Lease, (c) voluntarily surrender the Demised Premises or terminate the Lease, and (d) sublease or assign aII or any portion of the Demised Premises or the Lease.

default. Lessee shall not take any action with respect to such default under the Lease, including without limitation any action in order to terminate, rescind or avoid the Lease or to withhold
any rent or other monetary obligations thereunder, for a period of thirty (30) days after receipt of such written notice by Beneficiary; provided, however, that in the case of any default which cannot with diligence be cured within said thirty
(30) day period, if Beneficiary shall proceed promptly to cure such default and thereafter prosecute the curing of such default with diligence and continuity, the time within which such default may be cured shall be extended for such period as
may be necessary to complete the curing of such default with diligence and continuity.  9. Notices. All notices or other communications
required or permitted to be given pursuant to the provisions hereof shall be in writing and shall be considered as properly given if (i) mailed to the addressee by first class United States mail, postage prepaid, registered or certified with
return receipt requested, (ii) by delivering same in person to the addressee, or (iii) by delivery to a third party commercial delivery service for same day or next day delivery to the office of the addressee with proof of delivery. Notice
