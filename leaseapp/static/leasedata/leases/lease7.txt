Premises)  A. Leased Premises: LESSOR hereby leases and demises to LESSEE, subject to and with the benefit of the terms,
covenants, conditions and provisions of this Lease, a certain portion of the building located at 173-179 Portland Street, Boston, MA 02114, known as Units 3 and 4 of the 175 Portland Street Condominium (the Condominium) at as more

40837, Page 1 (the Declaration of Trust), comprised of approximately 5,952 rentable square feet, as shown on the attached Exhibit A (collectively, the Leased Premises).  
B. Condition of Premises: LESSEE agrees to accept delivery of the Leased Premises on the Effective Date (as defined in Article III) in its
as is condition. LESSEE acknowledges that LESSOR is not required to perform any work or improvements to the Leased Premises as a condition to LESSEEs initial occupancy thereof or the inception of this Lease, other than the LESSOR
agrees to paint one wall in the entry lobby of each floor of the Leased Premises to be agreed upon by the parties prior to the Effective Date. Additionally, LESSOR agrees to warrant that the Leased Premises shall be delivered to LESSEE with all base
building mechanical, electrical and plumbing systems and HVAC equipment in good working order with a remaining useful life equal or greater than the Term hereof. Additionally, LESSEE shall have the use of the furniture in the Leased Premises set
forth in the inventory attached hereto as Exhibit B (the Furniture). LESSEE shall accept the Furniture in its as-is, where-is condition and shall return the Furniture at the end of the Initial Term or Option Term, as the case
may be, in the same condition as the Furniture was as of the Effective Date, reasonably wear and tear and damage by fire or other casualty excepted. LESSOR represents and warrants that LESSOR has good title to the Furniture free and clear of any
liens or encumbrances and is able to provide use of the Furniture to LESSEE without any third party consents or approvals.  In addition, LESSEE shall have
access to the Leased Premises at least 15 days prior to the Effective Date for the purpose of installing furniture, fixtures, equipment, wiring and cabling so long as said installation does not materially delay the painting required to be performed
by LESSOR as described above. 


ARTICLE III (Term) 
The initial term of the Lease shall be for three (3) years commencing on the date (the Effective Date) that the Leased
Premises is delivered in the condition described in Section IIB and LESSEE may legally occupy the Leased Premises, and LESSOR has completed the required painting described in Article IIB, which date shall be no sooner than August 1, 2014 or
such earlier date that LESSEE and LESSOR mutually agree that LESSEE may occupy for the conduct of its business and ending on the last day of the month in which the day immediately prior to the third
(3rd) anniversary occurs (the Initial Term).  If Lessor has not
delivered the Leased Premises to Lessee in the condition required under this Lease on August 1, 2014, Lessee shall be entitled to a credit against the base rent first due under this Lease in an amount equal to one day of base rent for each day
after August 1, 2014 that the Leased Premises has not been so delivered.  So long as LESSEE is not in default of any of the terms and
conditions of the Lease, beyond applicable notice and cure periods, LESSEE may, at LESSEES option, extend the term of this Lease for an additional three (3) years (the Option Term) by serving written notice upon LESSOR at
least one hundred eighty (180) days prior to the expiration of the Initial Term. If LESSEE timely exercises the option to extend the Initial Term for the Option Term, the Option Term shall be upon all of the terms and conditions of this Lease.
The Initial Term and Option Term are sometimes collectively referred to as the Term.  ARTICLE IV (Rent) 
The LESSEE shall, for the Initial Term of this Lease, pay to the LESSOR, base rent at the rate of Two Hundred Twenty Six Thousand One Hundred
Seventy Six and 00/100 Dollars ($226,176.00) per Lease year. All base rent accruing until the first anniversary of the Effective Date shall be payable on the first day of each month, in advance, in monthly installments of Eighteen Thousand Eight
Hundred Forty Eight and 00/100 Dollars ($18,848.00). Beginning on the first anniversary of the Effective Date, base rent shall be payable at the rate of Two Hundred Thirty Two Thousand One Hundred Twenty Eight and 00/100 Dollars ($232,128.00) per
Lease year in monthly installments of Nineteen Thousand Three Hundred Forty Four and 00/100 Dollars ($19,344.00). Beginning on the second anniversary of the Effective Date, base rent shall be payable at the rate of Two Hundred Thirty Eight Thousand
Eighty and 00/100 Dollars ($238,080.00) per Lease year in monthly installments of Nineteen Thousand Eight Hundred Forty and 00/100 Dollars ($19,840.00). All base rent during the Option Term shall be set as the Current Market Rent Rate (as defined
below). Any and all base rent due to LESSOR during the Term is hereinafter referred to as the Base Rent. All payments of Base Rent shall be made by wire transfer of funds or ACH Transfers to accounts as may be designated in writing from
time to time by LESSOR. Base Rent, Additional Rent and any other charges due from Tenant hereunder shall be appropriately pro-rated and paid by Tenant for any partial month or other applicable period at the beginning or end of the Term. 
  2 


Provided Tenant shall not be in default under this Lease beyond applicable notice and cure
periods, LESSEE shall have one (1) three (3) year option to extend the Term of this Lease at the Current Market Rent Rate (defined below) with the base rent increased by One Dollar ($1.00) per square foot each year for years 2 and 3 of the
extended Term. LESSEE shall give LESSOR written notice of its intent to extend the Term of this Lease no less than six (6) months prior to the expiration of the Term of this Lease, as the same may be extended. The term Current Market Rent
Rate for purposes of this Lease shall mean the annual amount per rentable square foot that a willing, comparable, new, non-renewal, non-equity, non-expansion
tenant of credit quality similar to LESSEE would pay, and a willing, comparable landlord of the Building or a comparable office building in the immediate vicinity of the Building would accept, at arms length, giving appropriate consideration to
annual rental rates per rentable square foot, escalation clauses (including type, gross or net, and if gross, whether base year or expense stop), and abatement provisions reflecting free rent, length of lease term, size and location of premises
being leased, improvement allowances (if any), brokerage commissions (if any), and any other concessions which would be granted by LESSOR or a comparable landlord and other generally applicable terms and conditions, but at no time less than the base
rent payable during the third year of the Initial Term.  If LESSEE exercises the extension option, LESSOR and LESSEE shall attempt to
agree upon the Current Market Rental Rate using their best good-faith efforts. If LESSOR and LESSEE fail to reach an agreement within thirty (30) days following LESSEEs exercise of such extension
option (the Outside Agreement Date), then each party shall make a separate determination of the Current Market Rental Rate which shall be submitted to each other and to arbitration in accordance with the following items (i) through
(vii):  (i) LESSOR and LESSEE shall each appoint, within ten (10) business days of the Outside Agreement Date, one arbitrator who
shall by profession be a current real estate broker or appraiser of comparable properties in the immediate vicinity of the Building, and who has been active in such field over the last five (5) years. The determination of the arbitrators shall
be limited solely to the issue of whether LESSORs or LESSEEs submitted Current Market Rental Rate is the closest to the actual Current Market Rental Rate as determined by the arbitrators. 
(ii) The two arbitrators so appointed shall within five (5) business days of the date of the appointment of the last appointed arbitrator
agree upon and appoint a third arbitrator who shall be qualified under the same criteria set forth hereinabove for qualification of the initial two arbitrators. 
(iii) The three arbitrators shall within fifteen (15) days of the appointment of the third arbitrator reach a decision as to whether the
parties shall use LESSORs or LESSEEs submitted Current Market Rent Rate, and shall notify LESSOR and LESSEE thereof.  (iv) The
decision of the majority of the three arbitrators shall be binding upon LESSOR and LESSEE.  (v) If either LESSOR or LESSEE fails to
appoint an arbitrator within ten (10) business days after the applicable Outside Agreement Date, the arbitrator appointed by one of them shall reach a decision, notify LESSOR and LESSEE thereof, and such arbitrators decision shall be
binding upon LESSOR and LESSEE. 
  3 


(vi) If the two arbitrators fail to agree upon and appoint a third arbitrator, or both parties
fail to appoint an arbitrator, then the appointment of the third arbitrator or any arbitrator shall be dismissed and the matter to be decided shall be forthwith submitted to arbitration under the provisions of REBA Dispute Resolution, Inc., but
subject to the instruction set forth in this Article IV.  (vii) The cost of arbitration shall be paid by LESSOR and LESSEE equally. 
ARTICLE V (Security Deposit) 
Upon the execution of this Lease, LESSEE shall deposit with LESSOR an amount equal to $56,544.00 (the Security Deposit) to be held
by LESSOR during the Term. LESSOR may, at its option, apply all or part of the Security Deposit to cure any defaults of LESSEE, including, without limitation, that remain uncured beyond applicable notice and cure periods, including, without
limitation, any unpaid Rent or other charges due from LESSEE, or to compensate LESSOR for any loss or damage which LESSOR may suffer due to LESSEEs default. If LESSOR shall so use any part of the Security Deposit, LESSEE shall restore the
Security Deposit to its full amount within ten (10) days after LESSORs request. No interest shall be paid on the Security Deposit, no trust relationship is created herein between LESSOR and LESSEE with respect to the Security Deposit, and
the Security Deposit may be commingled with other funds of LESSOR. Within thirty (30) days of the expiration or termination of this Lease, and after LESSEE shall have vacated the Leased Premises in the manner required by this Lease, LESSOR
shall pay to LESSEE any balance of the Security Deposit not applied pursuant to this Article. As long as LESSEE is not in default hereof beyond applicable notice and cure periods as of July 31, 2015, LESSOR shall return $18,848.00 to LESSEE
upon the delivery of financial statements of LESSEE certified by an officer of LESSEE showing that as of December 31, 2014 the tangible net worth of LESSEE is equal to or better than the tangible net worth of LESSEE as of December 31,
2013.  ARTICLE VI (Taxes) 
LESSOR shall pay any municipal real property taxes assessed against the Leased Premises and the Property and sewerage taxes, betterments, and

execution of this Lease, all outstanding municipal real property taxes attributable to the Leased Premises and the Property have been paid in full. Beginning with Fiscal Year 2015, LESSEE shall pay any increases in Taxes over Taxes due for the

ARTICLE VII (Utilities) 
LESSEE shall pay for all LESSEES separately metered utilities, without exception; and further, LESSOR agrees to furnish reasonable heat

electricity, service or supplies from the source from which they are usually obtained for said

unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned. LESSEE shall have the right without LESSOR approval to sublet or assign the Leased Premises or any portion thereof to: (1) any successor of LESSEE resulting from a merger, consolidation, or other

permit any act or thing to be done or suffered which would or might cause the Master Deed and the rights of LESSOR thereunder to be cancelled, terminated or forfeited or cause LESSOR to become liable for any damages, claims or penalties, or cause
LESSOR to be or become in default of any of LESSORs obligations thereunder; and (b) to defend LESSOR with counsel reasonably acceptable to LESSOR and to indemnify and hold LESSOR harmless from and against any and all liability, loss,

Notwithstanding anything contained in this Lease to the contrary, LESSEE agrees and understands
that LESSOR shall have no obligation or responsibility whatsoever pursuant to this Lease or otherwise to provide or perform any service, repair, alteration or other obligation which is the obligation of Trustees to provide or perform pursuant to the
provisions and terms of the Master Deed or Declaration of Trust. However, if LESSEE shall notify LESSOR that the Trustees are not supplying services to the Leased Premises as required under the Master Deed or Declaration of Trust, LESSOR, at
LESSORs sole cost and expense, will request Trustees to perform such services. LESSOR shall in no event be liable to LESSEE nor shall LESSEEs obligation under this Lease be impaired or reduced or the performance thereof excused because
of any failure or delay on the part of Trustees in providing any services or in making any repairs or alterations, or in performing or observing any obligation of Trustees under the Master Deed or Declaration of Trust whether or not LESSOR has a
similar obligation under this Lease (but if LESSOR has a similar obligation, the foregoing shall not be deemed to release LESSOR from such obligation). If Trustees shall default in any of its obligations to LESSOR with respect to the Leased
Premises, LESSOR shall, at LESSORs sole cost and expense, enforce LESSORs rights against Trustees (including, where appropriate pursuant to the terms of the Master Deed or Declaration of Trust, by arbitration or otherwise) with respect
to the Leased Premises, in LESSORs name; provided that LESSOR may not take any action which might, in the reasonable opinion of LESSOR, cause a forfeiture of LESSORs interest in the Leased Premises. LESSOR agrees to cooperate with LESSEE
in such action. In the event that LESSOR has not taken action to enforce such rights of LESSOR under the Master Deed or Declaration of Trust within ten (10) business days after written notice from LESSEE, LESSOR shall permit LESSEE to enforce
LESSORs rights against Trustees (including, where appropriate pursuant to the terms of the Master Deed or Declaration of Trust, by arbitration or otherwise) with respect to the Leased Premises, in LESSORs name; provided that LESSEE may
not take any action which might, in the reasonable opinion of LESSOR, cause a forfeiture of LESSORs interest in the Leased Premises. LESSOR shall reimburse LESSEE for fifty percent (50%) of the out of pocket costs incurred by LESSEE with
respect to such enforcement. LESSOR agrees to cooperate with LESSEE in such action, at LESSORS sole cost and expense. If Trustees shall default in the performance or observance of any of its agreements or obligations under the Master Deed or
Declaration of Trust (including any obligation for the payment of money), LESSOR shall have no liability therefor to LESSEE unless LESSOR has a similar obligation pursuant to this Lease. 
LESSEE acknowledges that LESSOR has an interest in the Leased Premises following the Term of this Lease, and as a result thereof, wishes the
Leased Premises restored wherever possible if the Master Deed and Declaration of Trust is not effectively and fully cancelled, in the event of a fire, condemnation or other casualty. LESSEE therefore agrees that all rights in the Master Deed and
Declaration of Trust to cancel the Master Deed and Declaration of Trust or to nullify a cancellation as therein provided, whether on behalf of Trustees, the LESSOR or the LESSEE, shall be solely vested in LESSOR whether such nullification rights
exists by virtue of rebuilding the Leased Premises by the LESSOR and accepting an assignment of any insurance, condemnation or other casualty proceeds from Trustees. 
  10

is terminated, then this Lease shall simultaneously terminate and in the event any insurance or other casualty proceeds thereafter or thereupon are available to LESSOR pursuant to the Master Deed and Declaration of Trust, LESSEE shall have no right
or claim whatsoever to such funds or any portion thereof it being understood that such funds shall belong solely to LESSOR, except to the extent specifically set forth herein.

LESSOR or agents of the LESSOR may, at reasonable times with twenty-four (24) hours notice, except in cases of emergency, enter to inspect or make repairs and alterations as LESSOR should elect to do and may show the Leased Premises to others,
and at any time within six (6) months before the expiration of the Term, may affix to any suitable part of the Leased Premises a notice for letting or selling Leased Premises and keep the same so affixed without hindrance or molestation. LESSEE
agrees that said third parties shall be granted access to the Leased Premises upon reasonable notice to inspect such wells.  ARTICLE
XVII (Compliance with Laws)  LESSEE shall make all non-structural repairs, alterations, additions or replacements to the Leased

any kind of the LESSEE; and comply with the orders, regulations, variances, licenses and permits of or granted by governmental authorities with respect to zoning, building, fire, health and other codes, regulations, ordinances or laws applicable to
the Leased Premises, and the condition, use or occupancy thereof, except that LESSEE may defer compliance so long as the validity of any such order, regulation, code, ordinance or law shall be contested by LESSEE in good faith and by appropriate
legal proceedings, provided LESSEE first gives LESSOR appropriate assurance reasonable satisfactory to LESSOR against any loss, cost or expense on account thereof and either a cash deposit or a bond equal to any potential loss, cost or expense to
LESSOR, and provided such contest shall not subject LESSOR to criminal penalties or civil sanctions, loss of property or material civil liability.

Indemnification by LESSOR. Upon notice and demand by LESSEE, LESSOR agrees to indemnify,
defend and hold LESSEE and its shareholders, directors, officers, employees, other agents and affiliates (LESSEE Indemnitees) harmless from and against any and all losses, injuries, claims, demands, liabilities, obligations, suits,
penalties, forfeitures, costs or expenses of every type or kind, including reasonable attorneys fees actually incurred, disbursements and costs of investigation which are imposed upon, incurred by or asserted against LESSEE Indemnitees to the
extent resulting from (i) the negligent act or omission or willful misconduct of LESSOR or any officer, employee or agent under the control or supervision of LESSOR, (ii) the violation of any law, regulation or rule by LESSOR or any
officer, employee or agent under the control or supervision of LESSOR, except to the extent such claims, demands, causes of action, suits, proceedings or liabilities are attributable to the negligence or willful misconduct of any of the LESSEE
Indemnitees.  Any party seeking indemnification shall give prompt written notice to the other of such claim, but the failure to give such
notice shall not affect the right to indemnification except to the extent there is actual prejudice from such delay. The indemnifying party shall be entitled to assume the defense with counsel of its selection, and any further costs of legal defense
of the indemnified party shall be borne by the indemnified party. The indemnified party shall cooperate fully with the indemnifying party in the defense of the Claim. The indemnifying party may settle any such indemnified Claim on terms satisfactory
to the indemnifying party provided that such settlement does not include restrictions upon the business or operations of the indemnified party. 
Survival. The provisions of this Article XVIII shall survive the expiration or earlier termination of this Agreement. 
ARTICLE XIX [Reserved] 
ARTICLE XX (Casualty and Taking) 
Should a substantial portion of the Leased Premises be substantially damaged by fire or other casualty, or be taken by eminent domain, the
LESSEE may elect to terminate this lease by giving written notice of that effect to LESSOR within thirty (30) days after such occurrence. Any apportionment or adjustment of Rent shall be as of the time of termination. As used in this Article,
the word substantial shall mean twenty-five percent (25%) or more of the Leased Premises. When such fire, casualty, or taking renders any portion of the Leased Premises unsuitable for their intended use, a just and proportionate
abatement of Rent shall be made and the LESSOR shall, forthwith and diligently, restore the Leased Premises to its prior condition, suitable for its intended use as contemplated under the Lease. 
Without limitation, in no event, however, need LESSOR restore any portion of the Condominium which is not necessary to access the Leased
Premises and not necessary for the use and enjoyment of the Leased Premises by the LESSEE. 
  12 


ARTICLE XXI (Eminent Domain) 
If the whole or any part of the Leased Premises shall be taken or condemned for public or quasi-public use or purpose by any competent
authority, or conveyed in lieu thereof (a Taking), LESSEE shall have no claim against LESSOR and shall not have any claim or right to any portion of any amount that may be awarded as damages or paid as a result of such taking; and all
rights of the LESSEE to damages therefor, if any, are hereby assigned by the LESSEE to the LESSOR. Upon such taking, if the Term of this Lease shall terminate, LESSEE shall have no claims against the LESSOR for the value of any unexpired term of
this Lease. LESSEE, however, shall be entitled to claim, prove and receive in a condemnation proceeding such awards as may be allowed for damages to or the Taking of fixtures, equipment and other personal property installed by it and which is herein
permitted to remove from the Leased Premises at the end of the Term and any moving expenses, but only if such awards shall be separately awarded in addition to (and not out of or in diminution of) the award made to LESSOR. 
ARTICLE XXII (Default and Bankruptcy)  In
the event that:   


 
(a)
The LESSEE shall fail to pay any installment of Rent, or other sum herein specified, and such default shall continue for five (5) business days after written notice thereof, however, such notice shall only be
required to be given twice in any twelve (12) month period and following such one notice, no further notices of such failure shall be required to constitute a default during such twelve month period; or 
 


 
(b)
The LESSEE shall default in the observance or performance of any other of the LESSEES covenants, agreements, or obligations hereunder, and such default shall not be corrected within twenty (20) days after
written notice thereof, or if such default is of such a nature that it cannot be completely remedied within said period of twenty (20) days if LESSEE shall not within twenty (20) days institute and thereafter diligently prosecute to
completion all steps necessary to remedy the same; or   


 
(c)
The LESSEE shall abandon the Leased Premises and cease paying any Rent due under this Lease; or   


 
(d)
The LESSEE shall become insolvent, or shall make a transfer in fraud of creditors, or shall make an assignment for the benefit of creditors; or 
 


 
(e)
The LESSEE shall file or there shall be filed against LESSEE a petition in bankruptcy or reorganization or for an arrangement for the benefit of creditors under any Article or chapter if the United States bankruptcy
laws or under any similar law or statute of any State; or   


 
(f)
A receiver or trustee shall be appointed for all or substantially all of the assets of LESSEE. 
  13 


Then a default under this Lease shall be deemed to exist and the LESSOR may terminate this Lease by written
notice to LESSEE, specifying a date not less than five (5) days after the giving of such notice on which this Lease shall terminate and this Lease shall come to an end on the date specified therein as fully and completely as if such date were
the date herein originally fixed for the expiration of the Term of this Lease and LESSEE will then quit and surrender the Leased Premises to LESSOR, but LESSEE shall remain liable as hereinafter provided. In the event LESSEE fails to surrender the
Leased Premises, the LESSOR shall re-enter and take complete possession of the Leased Premises, and remove the LESSEES effects, without prejudice to any remedies which might be otherwise used for arrears of any Rent or other default. 
The LESSEE shall indemnify the LESSOR against all loss of Rent and other payments which the LESSOR may incur by reason of such termination
during the residue of the Term. If the LESSOR makes any expenditures or incurs any obligations for the payment of money in connecting therewith, including but not limited to, reasonable attorneys fees for instituting, prosecuting or defending
any action or proceeding, such sums paid or obligations insured, with interest at the prime rate then published in The Wall Street Journal plus three percent (3%) per annum and costs, shall be paid to the LESSOR by the LESSEE as additional rent
(the Additional Rent).  The LESSEE covenants and agrees, notwithstanding any termination of this Lease as aforesaid or any
entry or re-entry by the LESSOR, whether by summary proceedings, termination, or otherwise, to pay and be liable for on the days originally fixed herein for the payment thereof amounts equal to the several installments of rent and other charges
reserved as they would, under the terms of this lease, become due if this lease had not been terminated or if the LESSOR had not entered or re-entered, as aforesaid, and whether the Leased Premises be relet or remain vacant, in whole or in part, or
for a period less than the remainder of the term, and for the whole thereof; but in the event the Leased Premises be relet by the LESSOR, the LESSEE shall be entitled to a credit in the net amount of rent received by the LESSOR in reletting, after
deduction of all reasonable expenses incurred in reletting the Leased Premises (including, without limitation, commercially reasonable remodeling costs, brokerage fees, and the like), and in collecting the rent in connection therewith. and the
LESSEE hereby waives, to the extent permitted by applicable law, any obligation the LESSOR may have to mitigate the LESSORs damages; provided, however, that after the termination of this lease as a result of an event of default, the LESSOR
shall use reasonable efforts to re-let the demised premises As an alternative, at the election of the LESSOR, the LESSEE will upon such termination pay to the LESSOR, as damages, such a sum as at the time of such termination represents the amount of
the excess, if any, of the then value of the total rent and other benefits which would have accrued to the LESSOR under this lease for the remainder of the lease term if the lease terms had been fully complied with by the LESSEE over and above the
then cash rental value (in advance) of the premises for the balance of the term. To induce the LESSOR to enter into this lease, each party hereby waives any right to trial by jury in any action, proceeding or counterclaim brought by the other party
on any matter whatsoever arising out of or in any way connected with this Lease, the relationship of the LESSOR and the LESSEE and the LESSEEs use and occupancy of the Leased Premises and/or any claim of injury or damage. 
  14 


Nothing contained in this Lease shall, however, limit or prejudice the right of LESSOR to prove
for and obtain in proceeding under any federal or state law relating to bankruptcy or reorganization or arrangement, an amount equal to the maximum allowed by any statute or rule of law in effect at the time when, and governing the proceedings in
which, the damages are to be proved, whether or not the amount be greater than the amount of the loss or damages referred to above.  Any
and all rights and remedies which LESSOR may have under this Lease, and at law and equity, shall be cumulative and shall not be deemed inconsistent with each other, and any two or more of all such rights and remedies may be exercised at the same
time insofar as permitted by law.  Any consent or permission by LESSOR to any act or omission which otherwise would be a breach of any
covenant or condition herein, or any waiver by LESSOR of the breach of any covenant or condition herein, shall not in any way be held or construed (unless expressly so declared) to operate so as to impair the continuing obligation of any covenant or
condition herein, or except as to the specific instance, operate to permit similar acts or omissions. The failure of LESSOR to seek redress for violation or to insist upon the strict performance of, any covenant or condition of this Lease shall not
be deemed a waiver of such violation nor percent a subsequent act, which would have originally constituted a violation, from having all the force and effect of an original violation. The receipt by LESSOR of Rent with knowledge of the breach of any
covenant of this Lease shall not be deeded to have been a waiver of such breach or covenant of this Lease and shall not be deemed to have been a waiver of such breach by LESSOR unless such waiver is in writing signed by the LESSOR. No consent or
waiver, express or implied, by LESSOR to or of any breach of any agreement or duty shall be construed as a waiver or consent to or of any other breach of the same or any other agreement or duty. 
ARTICLE XXIII (Notice)  Any notice from
the LESSOR to the LESSEE relating to the Leased Premises or to the occupancy thereof, shall be deemed duly served as of the date sent, by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid, or via hand delivery or via a
recognized next business day delivery service and addressed as follows:

expiration of the Term, or the earlier termination of this Lease, and prior to LESSEEs performance of its obligations to yield up the Leased Premises under this Article, LESSEE shall pay to LESSOR as Rent an amount equal to one hundred ten

partys dealings in connection with this Lease or the negotiation thereof. Colliers International shall be paid a commission by LESSOR pursuant to a separate agreement.
